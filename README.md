# Climate Change Cartograms

Cartograms are maps that, instead of representing geographic reality, are distorted according to some metric. Here, they are used to depict the impact of climate change on our planet.

This project started with the aim of interactively visualizing climate change on a global map. The idea to use cartograms has been inspired and influenced by sources [1-5]. For more information about the underlying algorithms and data and their sources, see the [generate/](generate/) directory.
