# Wildfire Frequency and Season Length

Mapping of the RCP scenarios to combined wildfire frequency and season length.

Data sampled from [1] is converted from deltas to absolute values for each RCP scenario based on the baseline. It is normalized to a 0-1 scale over all RCP scenarios, but separately for frequency and season length. For each data point, frequency and season length are averaged and again scaled over all RCP scenarios.

Combining frequency and season length indicators is a simplification that is most likely not suitable for more in-depth investigation.
