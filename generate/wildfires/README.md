# Wildfire Frequency and Season Length

Mapping of the RCP scenarios to combined wildfire frequency and season length.

Data sampled from [1] is converted from deltas to absolute values for each RCP scenario based on the baseline. It is normalized to a 0-1 scale over all RCP scenarios, but separately for frequency and season length. Currently, only the frequency is taken into account for the map.
