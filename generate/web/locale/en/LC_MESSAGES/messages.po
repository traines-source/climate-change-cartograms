"This map does not show geographic reality, but the reality of climate "
"change. Depending on what you select, it shows the areas or people that "
"will be most affected by wildfires, sealevel rise and unbearable heat. "
"Places are enlarged or shrinked relative to how affected they are. Like "
"that, regional effects that may however impact a lot of people are made "
"visible on a world map."

msgid "disclaimer"
msgstr ""
"Please bear in mind that the exact impacts of climate change are "
"difficult to predict, even more so on a regional level. This map might "
"exaggerate them, but more likely it might underestimate them. There are "
"many tipping points and feedback loops that are poorly understood, and if"
" triggered, they might lead to even more extreme impacts. Please also "
"note that there are many more effects of climate change that are not "
"(yet) represented on this map."
