msgid "2100_description"
msgstr ""
"The state as of the year 2100 according to a reference scenario, which "
"projects a global warming of 3.3°C – or less, if appropriate actions are "
"taken. Also see sources [7-15]."

msgid "coalplants_description"
msgstr ""
"Coal and gas power plants are responsible for a large part of CO₂ "
"emissions. Here it is assumed that of the total emissions from now until "
"2100 according to the reference scenario, 80%% are avoided. Also see "
"sources [7-15]."

msgid "industry_description"
msgstr ""
"CO₂ emissions by industry, e.g. during steel production. Of course, we "
"are indirectly responsible for these emissions through our consumption "
"behaviour as well. The assignment of CO₂ emissions to different sectors "
"is not always easy. Also see sources [7-15]."

msgid "roadtraffic_description"
msgstr ""
"Traffic in total is responsible for about 20%% of CO₂ emissions. Here it "
"is assumed that freight traffic on the road and short distance car "
"traffic (below about 15 km) is reduced by 80%% each."

msgid "buildings_description"
msgstr ""
"Buildings are responsible for CO₂ emissions, particularly due to heating."
" Here it is assumed that the emissions are reduced by 80%%. Also see "
"sources [7-15]."

msgid "15degrees_description"
msgstr ""
"In order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, many more issues"
" need to be acted on. For instance in cement production, agriculture, and"
" consumption of animal products. Also see sources [7-15]."

msgid "population_description"
msgstr ""
"If the population toggle is enabled, impacts will be multiplied by the "
"population density. That is, the size of areas on the map is proportional"
" to the impact on people living in these areas. The population density "
"for the year 2100 is projected using the estimated population growth on a"
" per-country level. Also see sources [18-20]."

msgid "wildfires_description"
msgstr ""
"Depicted on the map is a combined metric of the length of the wildfire "
"season and the frequency of wildfires. Due to climate change, both "
"increase in many regions around the world. Also see sources [31]."

msgid "sealevel_description"
msgstr ""
"On this map, areas that disappear are not submerged by water, they are on"
" the contrary not impacted by sealevel rise. Those areas that are shown "
"lie below sea level or, statistically speaking, experience flooding at "
"least once a year, for instance due to storm surges. Already today, some "
"areas of land lie below sea level. Due to climate change, the sea level "
"will probably rise by more than one meter. This increases the danger of "
"erosion, flooding and salinization and makes preventive measures like "
"levees increasingly difficult. Also see sources [21-23]."

msgid "wbgt_description"
msgstr ""
"Humans sweat to avoid overheating. When the air is not only hot, but also"
" very humid, that doesn't work anymore. The sweat cannot evaporate, the "
"body can't cool itself anymore. A so-called wet-bulb temperature of 35°C "
"is the theoretical limit that a human can survive without air "
"conditioning – even in the shade and with enough water. 30°C are already "
"dangerous. Places that reach wet-bulb temperatures of more than 35°C "
"multiple times a year are shown on the map. Also see sources [24-30]."

msgid "about_title"
msgstr "About this map"

msgid "about"
msgstr ""
"This map does not show geographic reality, but the reality of climate "
"change. Depending on what you select, it shows the areas or people that "
"will be most affected by wildfires, sealevel rise and unbearable heat. "
"Places are enlarged or shrinked relative to how affected they are. Like "
"that, regional effects that may however impact a lot of people are made "
"visible on a world map. In a perfect world without negative impacts, this"
" map would thus be empty."

msgid "disclaimer"
msgstr ""
"Please bear in mind that the exact impacts of climate change are "
"difficult to predict, even more so on a regional level. This map might "
"exaggerate them, but more likely it might underestimate them. There are "
"many tipping points and feedback loops that are poorly understood, and if"
" triggered, they might lead to even more extreme, self-amplifying "
"impacts. Please also note that there are many more effects of climate "
"change that are not (yet) represented on this map."
