# Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature

Mapping of the RCP scenarios to projected ten-year maximum monthly mean Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature according to data sampled from [1]. The data is normalized to a 0-1 scale over all RCP scenarios.

Please note that the really dangerous WBGTs of over 35 degrees Celsius do not necessarily show up in the monthly means (cf. [2]). Monthly means were chosen over maximum WBGTs due to their smoother geographical distribution, which is more appropriate for cartograms.
