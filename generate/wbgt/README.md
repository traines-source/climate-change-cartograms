# Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature

Mapping of the RCP scenarios to projected 0.99 quantile of daily maximum wet-bulb globe temperature in the year 2100. I.e. three days in 2100 will have a higher WBGT. The data is normalized to a 0-1 scale over all RCP scenarios, with 0 corresponding to a WBGT of 35 and lower (35 is the theoretical limit for human tolerance [1], 30 already implies starting health and productivity impacts) and 1 corresponding to a WBGT of 40 and higher.

Projections are based on the IPSL-CM5A-MR [2] and BCC_CSM 1.1(m) [8] CMIP5 models. WBGTs are calculated at daily intervals from the maximum 2m temperature in the last 24 hours, mean sea level pressure, near-surface specific humidity and elevation [3] according to a simplified WBGT formula ("sWBGT") [4, 5], albeit with adjusted constants according to [9]. 0.99 quantiles for the year 2100 are calculated from these daily values and finally averaged over the two models. For the baseline, year 2005 projections of the same models are used.

The sWBGT is to be used with caution, as it can significantly overestimate WBGTs in some areas and underestimate it in others [10]. The adjusted constants according to [9] seem to alleviate this issue according to our experiences. Furthermore, it makes the baseline projections better match the WBGTs actually measured today according to [7]. Further comparison can be done with [1], who calculate a daily maximum sWBGT over many more of the CMIP5 models and [6], who calculate monthly averages with a more sophisticated formula.

Comparison of the 2005 baseline with the NCEP reanalysis 2 data [11] for the same year indicates that on average the CMIP5 models tend to underestimate sWBGTs. No calibration is performed.
